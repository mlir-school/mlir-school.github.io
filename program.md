*The summer school will begin on the morning of Monday, September 8. If you are travelling from afar, we recommend arriving the day before, on Sunday the 7th, in Cambridge. Each day, a range of parallel sessions will be available in addition to the introductory courses on MLIR. The final day will be dedicated to a compilation community workshop, providing an opportunity to share and discuss the latest research breakthroughs.*
