MLIR is revolutionizing compiler technology! In just a few years, MLIR has established itself as a de facto standard for AI, EDA, quantum computing, and crypto compilers. The resulting many-domain ecosystem is of unseen size and diversity, creating exciting opportunities for formal verification and the use of AI for compilers. We need high-bandwidth communication for efficient cross-domain collaboration that welcomes new community members to push MLIR forward.

In the gardens of Robinson College Cambridge, we **bring together MLIR experts, application specialists, and students** to accelerate MLIR innovation through a unique pairing of foundational courses with dynamic, expert-focused, interactive workshops.
