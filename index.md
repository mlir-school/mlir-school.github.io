MLIR is at the core fast evolving compiler technology for AI, EDA, quantum computing, crypto, and more. In just a few years, MLIR has been widely adopted across academia and industry, establishing itself as a shared infrastructure and a de facto standard in many domains. Its modular, extensible design is enabling the next generation of tools and research to thrive on top of a solid, reliable foundation. The resulting many-domain ecosystem is larger and more diverse than seen in pre-existing compiler frameworks, creating exciting opportunities for formal verification or the use of AI for compilers. As the MLIR ecosystem expands, high-bandwidth communication across domains is critical to enable efficient collaboration among key stakeholders and to empower new community members to take on projects that push MLIR forward.

At the **Cambridge MLIR Summer School and Workshop we **bring together core MLIR stakeholders, application domain-experts, and curious young students** to align interests and kick-off MLIR collaboration and innovation projects for the next year(s). We achieve this by offering a unique pairing of newcomer-friendly foundational courses with dynamic, expert-lead, interactive workshops aimed at enabling high-bandwidth
communication across stakeholders.
