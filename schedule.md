<p><a id="intro-hands-on" class="anchor"><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Introduction To MLIR - hands on</b></a>, <i>Sasha Lopoukhine, Mathieu Fehr, Théo Degioanni</i></p>
This hands-on, introductory class is your perfect entry point to MLIR (Multi-Level Intermediate Representation). We will start from the ground up, demystifying what MLIR is and exploring its intermediate representation (IR) through a simple array DSL. Through a series of interactive examples, you will learn how to understand MLIR IR and apply passes to transform it. We'll demonstrate the power and benefits of defining your own MLIR dialect and progressively lower code from a high-level representation to a lower-level one. By the end of this session, you will have the keys to understand MLIR foundations, and what you could do with it in your projects.

<p><a id="define-dialects" class="anchor"><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Define And Lower Your New Dialect</b></a>, <i>Sylvain Noiry</i></p>
In this hands-on session, you will learn how to create the “List” dialect, introduced in the first lesson. You will practice in an out-of-tree MLIR project and develop your dialect in the standard way, without using xDSL or IRDL. This will give you an opportunity to apply the concepts learned in the previous lessons.

The session is organized into multiple exercises, each exploring a different aspect of dialect creation. Every exercise comes with a README, hints, and links to the portion of the official MLIR documentation. You can progress in the exercises either with the teachers or at your own pace.

The goal is to provide you with both the knowledge and a project template to help you create your own dialect for your ideas.

<p><a id="interfaces" class="anchor"><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Understanding Interfaces</b></a>, <i>Matthias Springer</i></p>

Interfaces are a cornerstone of extensibility and modularity in MLIR. This session covers operation interfaces, type interfaces and attribute interfaces, and how to design and implement them. The main part of the session will focus on existing core interfaces in MLIR. Attendees will gain insight into how interfaces drive analyses and transformations, improve code structure, and facilitate scalable compiler development.
Topics Covered:

<ul>
<li>What interfaces are, where they are used in MLIR and how to design / implement interfaces.</li>
<li>Real-world examples and demonstrations of core interfaces: from memory effects and control-flow modeling to bufferization and type abstraction. This session covers a wide range of core MLIR interfaces that model op semantics and drive analyses / transformations.</li>
<li>Discussion of challenges and open questions in the design of the covered interfaces.</li>
</ul>

This session is ideal for both newcomers and experienced MLIR users interested in building robust and maintainable compiler components. Interactive discussions will provide opportunities to explore best practices and unresolved design problems in the MLIR ecosystem.

<p><a id="transform" class="anchor"><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Schedule Loop Nests with Transform</b></a>, <i>Alex Zinenko</i></p>

MLIR features support for declaratively specifying and controlling compiler transformations via the transform dialect. It allows one to request compiler transformations using compiler IR itself, which can be embedded into the original IR that is being transformed (similarly to pragmas) or supplied separately (similarly to scheduling languages). This talk presents the concepts of the MLIR transform dialect and related infrastructure. It will be accompanied by a practical demonstration of three use scenarios centered on loop optimization. After following the task, the attendees will be able to apply the transform dialect in their work and extend it when necessary. Basic familiarity with MLIR is a prerequisite.

<p><a id="lowlevelabs" class="anchor"><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Discover Low-Level MLIR Abstractions</b></a>, <i>Kunwar Grover</i></p>

One of the best ways to learn how to use MLIR is to build a language that you
can interact with and play around with. MLIR is "batteries included", and has
multiple dialects and transformations that exist in-tree, which are enough to
build a simple vector math DSL. In this lesson, we will aim to learn how to
move into and out of the MLIR ecosystem, moving in from a DSL frontend, getting
out to LLVM IR towards assembly, and using this DSL from a general purpose
programming language like Python.

<p><a id="kalray" class="anchor"><b style="font-size: 1.2em">Software Pipelining for Kernel Code Generation</b></a>, <i>Benoît Dupont de Dinechin</i></p>

Kalray has a deep learning graph compiler in production, which targets
a manycore processor built  from VLIW cores. This Kalray graph
compiler relies on a library of tensor processing kernels, most of
which have been manually optimized and software pipelined. A key
challenge is automating software pipelining for tensor processing
kernels. We first review the principles and implementation of software
pipeliners by modulo scheduling in C/C++ compilers. We then outline a
new modulo scheduling approach, currently prototyped in GCC, which we
plan to move to a MLIR-based kernel compiler.

(https://sites.google.com/site/benoitdinechin) is CTO at Kalray. He
directly contributed to the design and implementation of production
compilers with software pipelining at Cray Research,
STMicroelectronics, and Kalray. He is also the co-architect of the
Kalray VLIW cores and their tensor operators.
