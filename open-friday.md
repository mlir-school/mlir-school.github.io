**Note:** The registration for the MLIR (Un)School has closed. We will be hosting a public compiler social on Friday, September 12, with a capacity of 250 people. It will be free to attend and will soon be open for registration. Our Compiler Social is a great opportunity for the UK compiler community to socialize with the attendees of the MLIR (Un)School -- while listening to some exciting talks.
